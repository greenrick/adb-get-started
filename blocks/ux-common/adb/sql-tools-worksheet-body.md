Although you can connect to your Oracle Autonomous Database using local PC desktop tools like Oracle SQL Developer, you can conveniently access the browser-based SQL Worksheet directly from your ADW or ATP console.

1.  If you are not logged in to Oracle Cloud Console, log in and select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** from the navigation menu, make sure you are in the right compartment where you ADW is provisioned and navigate into your ADW Finance Mart instance.
