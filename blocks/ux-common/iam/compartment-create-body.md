A compartment is a collection of cloud assets, like compute instances, load balancers, databases, and so on. By default, a root compartment was created for you when you created your tenancy (that is, when you registered for the trial account). It is possible to create everything in the root compartment, but Oracle recommends that you create sub-compartments to help manage your resources more efficiently.

1. Click the three-line menu, which is on the top left of the console. Scroll down till the bottom of the menu, click **Identity & Security -> Compartments**. 

    ![Click Identity & Security then Compartments.](/blocks/ux-common/iam/images/oci-navigation-compartments.png " ")

    Then, click the blue **Create Compartment** button to create a sub-compartment.

2. Give the compartment a name and description. Be sure your root compartment appears as the parent compartment. Press the blue **Create Compartment** button.

    ![Click the Create Compartment button.](http://127.0.0.1:5501/blocks/ux-common/iam/images/compartment-click-create.png " ")

    The compartment is created, in which you will create an Autonomous Database instance in the next steps.
