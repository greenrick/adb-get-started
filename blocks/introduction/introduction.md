# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop introduces you to many of the key Autonomous Database features across key functional areas:
* Provisioning and Data Loading
* Data analysis using SQL, machine learning, graph, spatial and tools like Oracle Analytics Cloud
* Integration with the Data lake
* Application Development
* Security
* Management and Monitoring

You can pick and choose any lab at any time - there is no required sequencing. After running a lab, you can then drill down into more details using the numerous 
workshops that are available on Oracle LiveLabs.

### __Oracle MovieStream Business Scenario__
The workshop's business scenario is based on Oracle MovieStream - a fictitious movie streaming service that is similar to services that you currently subscribe to. MovieStream has deployed a data lake in Oracle Object storage and will be using ADB as the serving layer for that data. You'll be working with data in a variety of formats - files (csv, parquet, json), tabular, json collections, graphs and more. 

### __Objectives__
* Learn how to work with many of Autonomous Database's key capabilities
* Use the workshop as a springboard into other areas you may want to explore
